Machine Learning for Data Analysts

🔹 Lesson 1: Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
======================================================
Summary:
Machine Learning uses algorithms to help systems learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming.
Types:
---------
Supervised Learning – uses labeled data (e.g., predicting sales).
Unsupervised Learning – finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation).
Reinforcement Learning – learns through rewards and penalties.

Example:
Predicting house prices using historical features such as size, location, and number of rooms.

🔹 Lesson 2: Linear Regression for Prediction
=================================================
Summary:
Linear Regression finds the relationship between independent variables (X) and a dependent variable (Y).
Formula: Y = mX + b

Example:
Predict monthly sales (Y) based on ad spend (X).
Output → for every ₹1k spent, sales increase by ₹2.5k.

🔹 Lesson 3: Logistic Regression for Classification
======================================================
Summary:
Used when the target is categorical (Yes/No, 0/1).
Predicts probabilities with a sigmoid curve.

Example:
Predict whether a customer will churn (1) or stay (0) based on usage, age, and support tickets.

🔹 Lesson 4: Model Evaluation Metrics
==========================================
Summary:
To measure model performance:
Accuracy – % of correct predictions
Precision / Recall / F1-score – balance between false positives & negatives
R² Score – regression model strength

Example:
A churn model with accuracy = 0.88 but low recall means it misses many churners — not ideal for business.

🔹 Lesson 5: Case Study – Predicting Customer Churn
======================================================
Summary:
Steps:
---------
Collect and clean telecom customer data
Train logistic regression model
Evaluate accuracy, precision, and recall
Deliver business insight → “Target high-risk users with loyalty offers”

Example:
The model predicted 82% of churners correctly, reducing loss by ₹5 lakhs / month.
